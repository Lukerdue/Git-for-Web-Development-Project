Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    inline elements won't create a break in the content, and will be displayed next to the previous element.
    Block elements typically will create a new line on content
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        they're positioned relative to their ancestor or (if they don't have one) to the body, and will move with the viewport.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        display: inline-block?
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        a. block
            1. div
            2. p
            3. h1-h6
        b. inline
            1. span.
            2. img.
        c. inline-block
            1. nav?
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    elements have padding, borders, and margins. padding and margins are usually added automatically without the css,
    and they change the overall size of the element, not just the content. The alleged fix for this is box-sizing: border-box,
    which takes padding and border into account when setting dimensions for something on the webpage. (you still need to think
    about margins though)
